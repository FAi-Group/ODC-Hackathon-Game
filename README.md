# High Way to Hell 

## Description:
It is a c++ game made by as a final project of the 1-week software enginnering hackathon organized by Orange Digital Center.  


## Game Idea:

* It is actually a 2D game, but it simulates a 3D one through the visual dimension associated with the game.
* In the game, there is the main character tries to avoid certain characters appearing randomly on his way.


## Language and Libraries:

* C++ programming language.
* SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)



## Acknowledgment:

* The idea was inspired by Outrun game by FamTrinli : https://bit.ly/3Wz7XO2



## Future work:

Due to our limited time, we concentrated more on the logic and design of the game rather than the features. Therefore, we hope the following features to be added:
* A score that starts from the beginning of the game.
* Automatic quit after hitting any of the road characters.
